# NotoWritey

NotoWritey is a text editor and outliner for TiddlyWiki that allows you to concentrate on writing documents one section (tiddler) at a time. By breaking documents down into their components, it makes it easier to follow the [[Philosophy of tiddlers|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Philosophy%20of%20Tiddlers]] and to reference individual sections of your document for use in references and quote extraction.

The outliner feature means that you can "fold" away sections of your writing that you're not working on so that you can concentrate just on your current writing.
